# **Translator**

Translator is a desktop application built with **Electron.js**, featuring **React** on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend. It leverages **OpenAI Whisper** for audio-to-text transcription, **Voicemeeter Banana** for system audio capture, and **Azure AI Translator** for language translation.

🚨 **Note:** This application is only compatible with **Windows**. 

## **Features**
- 🎤 **Audio Capture**: Capture audio from either a microphone or the system's audio output.  
- 📝 **Audio Transcription**: Convert captured audio to text using OpenAI Whisper.  
- 🌍 **Audio Translation**: Uses Azure AI Translator for language translation. [Get your Azure AI Translator key here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-translator).  
- ⏳ **Simulated Real-Time Transcription**: While Whisper is not designed for real-time transcription, the app simulates this behavior by continuously processing audio streams.  
- 🎧 **Voicemeeter Banana Integration**: Redirects system audio to a virtual microphone, allowing captured audio to be used for transcription.  
- ⚡ **Electron-Based UI**: A modern and responsive interface powered by React and Electron.  
- 🐍 **Python Backend**: Uses Python scripts executed via Node.js to handle audio processing.
