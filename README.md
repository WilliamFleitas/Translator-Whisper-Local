- ‚è≥ **Simulated Real-Time Transcription**: While Whisper is not designed for real-time transcription, the app simulates this behavior by continuously processing audio streams.  
- üéß **Voicemeeter Banana Integration**: Redirects system audio to a virtual microphone, allowing captured audio to be used for transcription.  
- ‚ö° **Electron-Based UI**: A modern and responsive interface powered by React and Electron.  
- üêç **Python Backend**: Uses Python scripts executed via Node.js to handle audio processing.
